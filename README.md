# RealTimeFaceDetection
Real Time Face Detection using GUI in Matlab.

 Graphical user interfaces (GUIs), also known as apps, provide point-and-click control of your software applications, eliminating the need for others to learn a language or type commands in order to run the application.
 
 This Matlab program requires Image Aquistion Toolbox,  Image Processing Toolbox and Computer Vision Toolbox.
 ### Image Acquisition Tool Box
   Image Acquisition Toolbox™ provides functions and blocks for connecting cameras and lidar sensors to MATLAB® and Simulink®.
   This Toolbox is used to trigger webcam in the Laptop.
 ### Image Processing Tool Box
  1. This Toolbox can be downloaded from apps in the toolbar of Matlab.
